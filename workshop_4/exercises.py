# Count vowels in string


'''
You are given a list of strings.
Write a Python program that counts the number of words in each string.
A word is defined as any sequence of characters separated by spaces.
Print each string along with the count of its words.
Use a for loop to iterate through the list of strings and split each string to count the words.
Ignore empty strings in the list.

Write a Python program that iterates over the numbers from 100 to 50, 
decrementing by 5 using a loop. For each number, 
print the number if it is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward). 
Skip non-palindromes using continue.
